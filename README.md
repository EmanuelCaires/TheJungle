# Design Choices

## Fonts
In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") 
to find a text that best suits the feel of the website.
 For the main text I have chosen 
 [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto "Roboto") 
 as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. 
 To make the headers and the stand out form the text.

#

I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.

## Colours

 * rgb(252, 151, 8) - This colour will be used as h1.

 * rgb(255, 255, 255) - This colour will be used on h2 paragraphs and butoon background color.

 * rgb(238, 27, 55) - This colour will be used as a  reset botoom color and feedback.

 * rgb(22, 93, 6) - This colour will be used as a  submit botoom color.



## Structure
I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

## Wireframes
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the club, a one-page website is used. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:

# Testing

I feel that the site has hit the goals required by all parties. 
The site responds nicely to all different screen sizes, 
the images look clean and sharp on all device sizes with very little, 
large blank spaces. It allows the user to navigate around easily and
 aslo make contact via the contact form or social media simply. It the content is simple and to the point and the site is not overcrowded as to put the user off.

 To test the website i will use chrome develepor tools to resize my browser to emulate three mobile devices,(iphone 12 pro, iphone se pixel 5 ) and two tablets device (ipad air, ipad mini) and compare whit the wireframes that i created.The website it was responsive in all the mobile phone view and the tablet view,with one particular issue that was the burguer menu it did not collapse.after investigate i found that was using diferent version of bootstrap that was blocking to not colapse the nav menu.
 
+ During the validation process of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I encountered a few minors issues that required attention. After making the necessary amendments, I revalidated the HTML CSS AND JAVASCRIPT it successfully passed without any errors.

    - HTML (index.html) validator [results]("https://validator.w3.org/")
